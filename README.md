Smack
=====

Smack is a rewrite of [Pow][pow] for Linux. It aims for being similarly easy to use, but replacing native Rack support with [Foreman][foreman]. Initially, support for only systemd and NetworkManager under Arch is planned, although being able to run under Ubuntu Desktop shouldn't be too far away after then.
